## How to import user to another version

If you already have a user profile on one version of KillumindOS, here's how you can import your existing user to another version:
 
**1. Navigate to your user file's folder**
```
KillumindOS\systems\killumindos\files\users
```
**2. Copy and paste the folder inside the other KillumindOS**
in there, you should have a folder with your username.
simply copy that folder and paste it into the users folder inside the other version of KillumindOS

**3. Navigate to the files folder**
```
KillumindOS\systems\killumindos\files
```
**4. Copy and paste setup.txt**
inside the files folder, you should have an empty setup.txt file. Copy that file and navigate into the files folder of the other OS version and paste it there.

That's it! if you've done everything right, then you should be redirected to the login instead of the setup when your launching the bootloader
